Joaquina obtained an MSc in Biotechnology from Universidad Politécnica de Valencia (Spain), carrying out her MSc thesis at the German Cancer Research Center (DKFZ). She then moved to the US to undertake a PhD at Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory (NY), first funded by “laCaixa” Foundation and then by a Boehringer Ingelheim Fonds PhD Fellowship. She joined Gregory Hannon’s laboratory to study how long noncoding RNAs regulate stem cell differentiation and self-renewal using haematopoiesis as a model. For her postdoctoral research, Joaquina joined James Briscoe’s lab at The Francis Crick Institute to continue pursuing her interest on how the noncoding genome controls cell fate decisions. During her postdoc, she uncovered two cis regulatory strategies controling cell fate choice between ventral neural progranitors. Her work combines state-of-the-art genomics, proteomics and imagining, using stem cell models and embryology with the goal of achieving a molecular understanding of how cis-regulatory elements drive cell fate decisions in development.

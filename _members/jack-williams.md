Jack undertook an MSci in Chemistry at Imperial College London where he completed his final year and masters project at École Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne (EPFL) in Switzerland, under the supervision of Professor Christian Heinis. He then went on to do his PhD at the Francis Crick Institute in the lab of Louise Walport, using structural biology, genomics and proteomics to investigate the functions of key proteins in early embryo development and genome activation. It was during this time that he became fascinated by how embryos coordinate complex spatiotemporal genome regulation and differentiation programs.
 
In the Delás lab, Jack will be bringing his love for  protein-protein interactions and structure, to investigate how repressive transcription factors interact at cis-regulatory elements to direct transcriptional repression in the neural tube.
Outside of his work, Jack loves baking, running, playing chess and collecting Star Wars Lego

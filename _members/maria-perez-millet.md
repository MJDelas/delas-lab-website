María studied Biochemistry and Biomedical Sciences at the University of València. During her degree, she became fascinated with molecular biology and stem cells, and did internships at her university's Institute of Biotechnology and Biomedicine, Imperial College London and the Spanish National Centre for Cancer Research (CNIO), focusing on topics around neurogenesis and development. 

She joined Delas Lab after finishing her Master's thesis at the Mecanoadaptation and Caveolae Biology lab in the Spanish National Centre for Cardiovascular Research (CNIC). She’s passionate about understanding the molecular underpinnings of how cells decide their fate, with a special interest in cellular plasticity and reprogramming. 

She believes that scientific work is an extension of her creative self and, outside of her work in the lab, she enjoys writing, the guitar, arts&crafts and trying new recipes.

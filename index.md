# Cis regulatory control during development

Our lab is interested in understanding how cis-regulatory elements control cell fate decisions during development. While we know these non-coding sequences control gene expression, how they achieve this is still not understood. We have a particular interest in repressors, and how they act via cis-regulatory elements to mediate gene silencing.

We do this by combining stem-cell derived and in vivo models. By using state-of-the-art genomics, proteomics and microscopy approaches, we aim at understanding gene regulatory control by non-coding DNA elements at a molecular level during developmental cell fate decisions.

We are located at the [LMCB, UCL](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/lifesciences-faculty/laboratory-molecular-cell-biology/research/research-groups/delas-lab). We are currently building out team to get in touch if you would like to [**join us!**](/recruitment)

We are passionate about development, differentiation and gene regulation. We combine dry and wet lab, spanning from cellular models to embryology, genomics and lots of flow cytometry.
